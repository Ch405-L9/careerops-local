## Import requirements

Every capture requires:

- Platform/source name.
- Original URL, if available.
- Capture timestamp.
- Import method.
- Complete raw listing text whenever practical.

The importer must preserve source text, mark absent values `UNKNOWN`, and avoid guessing compensation, company legitimacy, work arrangement, seniority, or relocation.
