"""Configuration schemas.

Two distinct validation stages, kept separate on purpose:

1. Structural validation parses and type-checks the shipped configuration. It succeeds
   while policy decisions remain outstanding, so import, lint, type check, test, and CLI
   help all work.
2. Readiness validation is a separate, explicit step that fails while any key in
   `REQUIRED_UNRESOLVED_POLICY_KEYS` is still the UNRESOLVED sentinel.

Policy source: docs/SCORING_DECISIONS.md, owner-decision records dated 2026-09-25
(P-1 through P-6) and 2026-09-26 (A-5 through A-7). No assessment behaviour is implemented
here. The A-5 through A-7 models below validate policy data only: no allocation, no
normalization of listing or dossier text, and no technology matching is performed.
