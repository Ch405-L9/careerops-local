"""Single definition site for every CareerOps Local enum.

`RiskFlag`, `Recommendation`, and `ValidationStatus` are derived from PROJECT_GUARDRAILS.md.
`SalaryCompatibility` and `EvidenceTier` are derived from docs/SCORING_DECISIONS.md, the
owner-approved implementation decision record dated 2026-09-25.

`MatchMethod`, `RequirementKind`, and `TechnologyGapReason` are derived from the A-5 through
A-7 owner-decision record dated 2026-09-26. They have no canonical Markdown source and are
therefore not parity-bound; binding them would require a new labelled section in that record,
which is a separate owner decision.

tests/parity/test_canonical_enum_parity.py fails if any parity-bound enum drifts from its
source document. No enum may be defined or aliased anywhere else in this package.

Every enum below is declared in exactly one of `PARITY_BOUND_ENUMS` or
`SELF_DECLARED_ENUMS`. tests/unit/test_enums.py fails if a new enum is added without being
declared, so the distinction can never go silent.
