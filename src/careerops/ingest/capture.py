"""Parse an approved job capture into a `NormalizedJob`.

Parsing is by labelled field. No line number is ever used (standing ruling A-1), and no field
position is assumed: a capture may omit any optional field, reorder fields, or omit whole
sections. Every absent value becomes `UNKNOWN`.

Nothing is guessed. An unparseable enum value or a non-integer salary raises `CaptureFormatError`
naming the field and what was accepted, rather than falling back to `UNKNOWN` — a fallback would
turn a typo into silent data loss. The template's import rule requires exactly this: "preserve
source text, mark absent values UNKNOWN, and avoid guessing".

Template fields with no destination are discarded, which is deliberate for
`public_recruiter_or_contact` (D-9) and incidental for `company_description`, `remote_details`,
`travel_requirements`, `total_compensation`, `bonus`, `equity`, `benefits`,
`application_instructions`, `owner_notes`, and `raw_listing_text`. A future model change may give
some of them a home; none may acquire one by inference here.
