"""Technology-evidence matching (A-5, A-6, A-7).

Deterministic and pure: `(inputs, config)` in, values out. No I/O, no clock, no randomness.
Identical inputs always produce identical output.

Matching is whole-phrase equality of lookup keys. There is no token matching, substring
matching, fuzzy matching, semantic matching, embedding matching, LLM matching, or external
taxonomy or API lookup. A lookup key is derived using only the four approved A-6 steps: Unicode
NFC, casefold, whitespace collapse, trim.

One further route exists, added by owner decision on 2026-09-26: an owner-approved technology
category. Where a category is marked substitutable, holding a peer member earns reduced credit
and the match names the tool actually held, never the one requested; the gap is raised as well,
so reduced credit can never be read as the requested tool. Where a category is marked
non-substitutable, such as a programming language, a peer earns nothing and raises
CORE_LANGUAGE_GAP. Category membership is still whole-phrase: nothing is inferred, and credit
requires the candidate to hold a member in the approved dossier at a disclosed tier.

Every match carries the nine audit values `TechnologyMatch` requires, so an undisclosed match
is unconstructable (E-5). Best tier wins (E-3). A required technology with no evidence scores
zero and raises a gap (E-4); one supported only at Tier 2 or Tier 4 receives partial credit
and still raises a gap (E-7).

Preferred technologies are not accepted here at all: required technologies are the only input
to the dimension (A-7), and preferred extraction is deferred.
