"""Deterministic scoring.

One dimension is implemented: `verified_technical_skill_alignment`, per the approved A-5
formula. It returns a `TechnologyAlignmentResult`, which carries no total score, no
`MatchClassification`, no `Recommendation`, and no `ValidationStatus`, so a dimension figure
can never become a full assessment while the readiness gate stands.

Everything else remains a signature. `assess_job` and `assess_compensation` still raise, and
still require `load_ready_assessment_config`, which refuses while any of the five remaining
policy keys is UNRESOLVED. Scoring never overrides a blocker.

Total years of experience is never calculated and never inferred from job dates (D-4).

    Required slots are counted after normalization and deduplication by resolved identifier.

    entry is one slot until a grouped requirement source exists.

    Preferred technologies are accepted nowhere in this call: they enter neither the numerator
    nor the denominator (A-5), and preferred extraction is deferred (A-7).

    `terms` is the candidate evidence index, normally `candidate_terms()`. It is passed
    rather than fetched so the dependency is explicit and testable with synthetic terms.

    `points` is exact and unrounded. Rounding remains the unresolved `score_rounding_rule`, so
    this function never rounds, truncates, or clamps.

    Takes the structurally validated configuration. It does not call
    `load_ready_assessment_config`, because a single dimension is not a full assessment; that
