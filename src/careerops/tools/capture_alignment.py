"""Score a captured listing's required technologies against the approved dossier.

Reads a complete job capture, in `JOB_CAPTURE_TEMPLATE.md` format, from standard input, imports
it into a `NormalizedJob`, and prints the `verified_technical_skill_alignment` dimension.

Writes no file, reads no file other than `config/*.yaml` through the configuration loader, makes
no network call, and takes no external action. The capture never touches disk through this tool:
it arrives on standard input, so no path is accepted and no captures directory is created.

Not a CLI command. The Typer CLI stays `doctor`-only while
`report_and_cli_score_display_scope` is unresolved. One dimension of nine is printed, never a
match score, classification, or recommendation.

Eight of the nine dimensions have no allocation rule yet, so the fields this importer now
populates - work arrangement, relocation status, employment type, company URLs - are read and
disclosed but not scored.

Usage:

    PYTHONPATH=src python -m careerops.tools.capture_alignment < capture.md
