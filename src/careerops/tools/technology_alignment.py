"""Score one listing's required technologies against the approved dossier.

Reads one required technology per line from standard input and prints the
`verified_technical_skill_alignment` dimension. Writes no file, reads no file other than
`config/*.yaml` through the configuration loader, makes no network call, and takes no external
action.

This is not a CLI command and not a report. The Typer CLI stays `doctor`-only while
`report_and_cli_score_display_scope` is unresolved. What is printed here is one dimension of
nine, never a match score, never a classification, and never a recommendation.

Output order follows P-6 and rule C-5: provenance, the evidence-tier map, then gaps, and the
points last. The score never appears in the first line or in any heading.

No capture file is parsed. Splitting a capture's `required_technologies` block would be a new
delimiter rule, and A-6 forbids punctuation stripping, so a pasted line keeping its bullet or
trailing comma will not match. Gaps print their raw phrase with `repr()` so such artifacts are
visible rather than mysterious.

Usage:

    printf 'Python\\nRAG\\nReact.js\\n' | PYTHONPATH=src python -m careerops.tools.technology_alignment
