"""Rank several captured listings side by side.

Reads one or more captures from standard input, separated by a line containing only `===`, and
prints a short ranked list: title, company, link, technology points, salary position, and the
first gap. Then the per-listing detail.

Writes no file, makes no network call, and takes no external action. Not a CLI command: the
Typer CLI stays `doctor`-only while `report_and_cli_score_display_scope` is unresolved.

Only one of nine dimensions is scored, so the ranking is by technology alignment, and it says so.
No match score, classification, or recommendation is produced.

Usage:

    cat capture1.md sep.md capture2.md | PYTHONPATH=src python -m careerops.tools.listing_report

where `sep.md` is a file containing only `===`. Or paste captures separated by that line.
