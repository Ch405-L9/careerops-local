"""Assessment result models.

`TechnologyMatch.tier` has no default, so an untiered technology match cannot be constructed
(D-7). Reports must disclose the tier behind every match.

`Assessment.score` is optional and unset: no scoring logic exists, and the remaining five
policy keys still gate readiness.

`TechnologyMatch` carries the nine values the A-6 audit rule requires, each mandatory, so an
undisclosed match is unconstructable (E-5). `TechnologyGap` records an unsatisfied required
slot and its reason (E-4, E-6, E-7). `TechnologyAlignmentResult` is the dimension-result type
permitted while the readiness gate stands: it deliberately carries no total score, no
`MatchClassification`, no `Recommendation`, and no `ValidationStatus`, so the dimension path
cannot produce a full assessment. `Assessment` remains reachable only through the gated
`assess_job`.

`MatchMethod`, `RequirementKind`, and `TechnologyGapReason` are defined in `careerops.enums`,
the single enum definition site, and imported here.
