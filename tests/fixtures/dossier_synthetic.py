"""A synthetic in-memory candidate dossier.

Entirely invented. It is not Anthony Grant's dossier and carries no contact details, no
ownership facts, and no years-of-experience figure. Tests use this rather than reading any
canonical document, so no test depends on canonical content that only the owner may change.
