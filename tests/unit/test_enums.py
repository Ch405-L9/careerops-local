"""Enum membership tests.

These assert the shape the rest of the system depends on. Parity against the source
documents is asserted separately in tests/parity/.

Five enums are copied from a labelled document section and are parity-bound there. The other
eight have no prose list to drift from, so they are guarded here instead by exact membership
assertions. `test_every_enum_declares_its_parity_category` fails if a new enum joins neither
group.
