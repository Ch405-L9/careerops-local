"""Capture import.

Capture text is built inline here rather than added as a fixture file: the compliance test
`test_no_real_captures_committed` permits exactly the two existing synthetic captures, and
adding a third would weaken it. Every capture below is invented.

Parsing is by labelled field. These tests assert that no field position is relied on, that
absence becomes UNKNOWN, and that a malformed value raises rather than degrading quietly.
